# GPO Export & Import Automation (PowerShell + LGPO)

This repository includes two PowerShell scripts for backing up and restoring Group Policy Objects (GPOs) in a Windows Active Directory domain environment.

These scripts support:
- Full GPO export (domain policies + local policy settings)
- Clean re-import into a domain
- Automated handling of local security policies via `LGPO.exe`

## ðŸ“„ Scripts Included

### `Export-GPOs.ps1`
Exports all GPOs from the domain to a folder next to the script. It also calls `LGPO.exe` to capture local policy settings.

### `Import-GPOs.ps1`
Imports GPOs from a specified folder back into the domain. This includes both domain policy settings and local security settings (via `LGPO.exe`).
